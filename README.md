# Orion drift spectator

## What this is:
- Data extracted from the game files
- Data who everyone, who has orion drift downloaded, has access to
- Data everyone has access to, simply published in a format that makes it easy to view without the extraction proccess
- A demonstration of poor security on the part of Another Axiom

## What this is not:
- An insider leak containing private data
- Data the public does **not** have access to already
- The actual Orion Drift spectator binaries

/UI seems interesting, I think its some overlay but it needs a connection to the spectator running locally (which I dont have)
